    <h2 class="font3 subtitle">Description</h2>
    <p class="para">You know... I wish I could explain this one... but, its not possible. From what I heard, it was a giant chemical explosion back in the early sixties that some crazy scientest bottled up.
        After that, He started selling the method to other sceintests. At first no one really cared, but after one broke and blew up a house it started to gain traction. As a weapon that it. But one day some kid from florida tried to kill himself by drinking one. He survived, but in the process he started a new trend. Srinking explosions. So here I am to teach you how to make them at home. </p>
